Here we go, easy flow
The setting sun is sinking low
Watch it now, wait for the flash
We've got the view if you got the cash

A little powder from the gun
On everything and everyone
Shooting doves out of the sky
I just like to, I don't know why

Robbing cradles and the graves
Just realistic, not depraved
Yawn and stretch, my little cats
I'm the water in your taps

I'm the sidewalk and your street
Own the bones, own the meat
Own the thoughts you ain't had yet
My little fish caught in the net

Little fish caught in the net
A little powder from the gun
Nothing but a blazing sun
Draining rivers 'til they're dry
I just like to, I don't know why
I just like to, I don't know why

Voices down an empty hall
You'll never see me at all
You will never see my face
And then my kids will own this place

And then my kids will own yours, too
If you were me, wouldn't you?
A little powder from the gun
Little soldiers run and run
Silver birds up in the sky

There's nothing that escapes my eye
There's nothing that escapes my eye
There's nothing that escapes my eye
Nothing that escapes my eye
Nothing that escapes my eye
Nothing that escapes my eye
Nothing that escapes my eye
Nothing that escapes my eye
