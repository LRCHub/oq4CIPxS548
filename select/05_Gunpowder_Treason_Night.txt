In the rainy streets of London back in 1605
An old mercenary named Guy Fawkes
Had orders to take the Parlament down
36 barrels of gunpowder placed under the halls
Enough to blow them all in the air
Enough to kill them all

And tonight 400 years later
Still celebrate his death

Remember, remember
The fifth of november
The Gunpowder treason and plot
And I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason
Should ever be forgot

The existence of a single letter
Brought the plans right down
And soon they were hunted
By the knights of the crown
They siezed Guy in the darkest hour
And put him into chains
In the black rooms of the towern
All he could feel was pain

And tonight 400 years later
Still celebrate his death

Remember, remember
The fifth of november
The Gunpowder treason and plot
And I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason
Should ever be forgot

Remember, remember
The fifth of november
The Gunpowder treason and plot
And I know of no reason
Why the gunpowder treason
Should ever be forgot
