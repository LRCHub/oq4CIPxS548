But slowly as we enter a new era
Of holistic ecology
The planet shall begin to heal herself
Through our consciousness
By changing our negative thought patterns
Into positive ones
And detaching from all of our past suffering
We can set our intentions
Toward a new Earth

How many times do you think this wheel has turned the same way?
How many times do you think this world has burned the same way?
Oh, no, no, no
No

Gunpowder on our fingers
Blood on our hands
And we turn it into what we can, yeah
Now wash away the feelin'
You can no longer stand
But it keeps on comin' back again, hey
We're livin' in twilight

Gunpowder on our fingers
Blood on our hands
We can't look into the mirror
When our heads are in the sand
There's smoke comin' through the window
And under our door
Are we runnin' to
Runnin' to
Runnin' to
What we ignore?

(Mmm)

Now rip another page out of your history
Turn your brother 'to your enemy
(Mhm)
(Oh)
And now associate all of your misery
With a root that's based in fallacy
Believing it blindly

Gunpowder on our fingers (Mmm)
Blood on our hands
(There's blood of our hands yeah)
We can't look into the mirror
When our heads are in the sand
(When our heads are in the sand)
There's smoke comin' through the window (Coming through the window)
And under our door (it's coming through the door)
Are we runnin' to (ay)
Runnin' to (ay)
Runnin' to (ay-ay)
What we ignore?
Are we runnin' to (running to)
Runnin' to (running to)
Runnin' to (running to)
What we ignore?
Are we runnin' to (running to)
Runnin' to (running to)
Runnin' to (running to)

Gunpowder on our fingers
Blood on our hands
We can't look into the mirror
When our heads are in the sand

And under our door
Are we runnin' to
Runnin' to
What we ignore?
